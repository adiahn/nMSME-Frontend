# nMSME Frontend - Duplicate Information Resolution

## Problem Solved

The application had a user experience issue where the same basic contact information (name, email, phone) was being collected multiple times across different pages:

1. **SignupPage** - Collected basic user information during account creation
2. **ApplicationPage** - Required the same contact information again during application
3. **DashboardPage** - Also collected personal information in the application form

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Global User Context
- Created a `UserContext` in `App.tsx` to manage user data globally
- User data is persisted in `localStorage` for session continuity
- Provides `useUser` hook for accessing user data throughout the application

### 2. Data Flow
```
SignupPage → Saves user data to global context → localStorage
LoginPage → Loads user data from localStorage → Authenticates user
ApplicationPage → Pre-fills forms with user data from context
DashboardPage → Pre-fills forms with user data from context
```

### 3. Key Features

#### Pre-filled Forms
- Contact information is automatically pre-filled in application forms
- Users can still edit the information if needed
- Clear visual indicators show which information is pre-filled

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Blue notification boxes** inform users about pre-filled information
- **Consistent data** across all forms
- **Reduced form friction** - users don't need to re-enter basic information

#### Authentication Flow
- Signup creates user account and stores data
- Login validates credentials and loads user data
- Logout clears user data and redirects to home

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### User Context Interface
```typescript
interface UserData {
  fullName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}
```

#### Key Functions
- `setUserData()` - Save complete user data
- `updateUserData()` - Update partial user data
- `useUser()` - Hook to access user context

#### Data Persistence
- User data automatically saved to `localStorage`
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Automatic loading on app startup

### 5. Files Modified

1. **`src/App.tsx`** - Added UserContext provider
2. **`src/pages/SignupPage.tsx`** - Save user data on account creation
3. **`src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`** - Load user data on authentication
4. **`src/pages/ApplicationPage.tsx`** - Pre-fill contact information
5. **`src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`** - Pre-fill personal information and add logout

### 6. User Journey

1. **New User**: Signup → Data saved → Forms pre-filled
2. **Returning User**: Login → Data loaded → Forms pre-filled
3. **Application Process**: Seamless experience with pre-filled data
4. **Logout**: Data cleared → Return to home page

## Benefits

- ✅ **Eliminated duplicate data entry**
- ✅ **Improved user experience**
- ✅ **Reduced form completion time**
- ✅ **Consistent data across application**
- ✅ **Persistent user sessions**
- ✅ **Clear user feedback about pre-filled data**

## Future Enhancements

- Add data validation and sanitization
- Implement proper backend integration
- Add user profile management
- Include data export/import functionality
- Add multi-factor authentication
